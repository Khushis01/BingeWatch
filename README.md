## ðŸ›  Algorithm followed for the build
  
### KNN machine learning algorithm
The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. It belongs to the supervised learning domain and finds intense application in pattern recognition, data mining and intrusion detection. It relies on labeled input data to learn a function that produces an appropriate output when given new unlabeled data. It is also called a â€˜lazy learner algorithmâ€™ because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it stores the dataset and at the time of classification, it performs an action on the dataset. Recipes in Python to use KNN as classifier as well as regressor. The accuracy of k-NN is greater than other machine learning algorithms.
  - `Time Complexity` : O(N * logN)
  - `Auxiliary Space` : O(1)

  
 ### Similarity Score : 
 How does it decide which item is most similar to the item user likes? Here come the similarity scores.
   
It is a numerical value ranges between zero to one which helps to determine how much two items are similar to each            other on a scale of zero to one. This similarity score is obtained measuring the similarity between the text details of both of the items. So, similarity score is the measure of similarity between given text details of two items. This can be done by cosine-similarity.
